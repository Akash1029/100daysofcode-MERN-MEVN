# 100daysofcode Challenge with MERN/MEVN Stack
This repository is a part of my #100daysofcode challenge where I will be learning and building projects using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) or MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) stack.

# About the Challenge
The #100daysofcode challenge is an initiative to code consistently for 100 days to improve programming skills, learn new technologies, and build projects. In this challenge, I will be focusing on the MERN/MEVN stack, which is widely used for developing modern web applications.

Each day, I will be working on a different project, learning new concepts, and documenting my progress. This repository will serve as a central hub for all the projects and code I develop during the challenge.

# Goals
The main goals of this challenge are:

    1. Improve my understanding of the MERN/MEVN stack and its individual components.
    1. Gain practical experience by working on real-world projects.
    1. Strengthen my coding skills and problem-solving abilities.
    1. Learn how to integrate various technologies and tools within the MERN/MEVN stack.
    1. Document my progress, learnings, and challenges faced throughout the journey.

# Progress and Documentation
I will be documenting my progress, learnings, and challenges faced throughout the challenge in the respective project README files. Each project's README file will include:

    1. Project description and goals
    1. Technologies used
    1. Installation instructions
    1. Usage and features
    1. Learnings and key takeaways
    1. Challenges encountered
    1. Resources and references

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more detailed documentation and code.
